I always loved chocapic's shaders, and how customizeable it was. But i wanted MORE.
i eventually started tweaking the shader, adding settings, breaking stuff, and after a while wanted to impose my own visual style onto the shader.
i wanted to emphasize a varying scene, where the lighting isn't always the same whenever or wherever you are.
